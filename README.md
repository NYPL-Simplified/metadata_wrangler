# Library Simplified Metadata Wrangler
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/NYPL-Simplified/metadata_wrangler)

This is the Metadata Wrangler for [Library Simplified](https://librarysimplified.org/). The metadata server utilizes and intelligently amalgamates a wide variety of information sources for library ebooks and incorporates them into the reading experience for users by improving selection, search, and recommendations.

It depends on the [LS Server Core](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/server_core) as a git submodule.

## Installation

Thorough deployment instructions, including essential libraries for Linux systems, can be found [in the Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions). **_If this is your first time installing a Library Simplified server, please review those instructions._**

Keep in mind that the metadata server requires unique database names and a data directory, as detailed below.

### Database

Create relevant databases in Postgres:
```sh
$ sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE simplified_metadata_test;
CREATE DATABASE simplified_metadata_dev;

# Create users, unless you've already created them for another LS project
CREATE USER simplified with password '[password]';
CREATE USER simplified_test with password '[password]';

grant all privileges on database simplified_metadata_dev to simplified;
grant all privileges on database simplified_metadata_test to simplified_test;
```

### Data Directory

Clone the Library Simplified data directory to a location of your choice:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/data.git YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY
```

In your content server configuration file, your specified "data_directory" should be YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY.

## Testing
The github actions CI service runs the unit tests against Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 automatically using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

To run `pytest` unit tests locally, install `tox`.

```
pip install tox
```

Tox has an environment for each python version and an optional `-docker` factor that will automatically use docker to deploy service containers used for the tests. You can select the environment you would like to test with the tox `-e` flag.

### Environments

| Environment | Python Version |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| py36        | Python 3.6     |
| py37        | Python 3.7     | 
| py38        | Python 3.8     | 
| py39        | Python 3.9     |

All of these environments are tested by default when running tox. To test one specific environment you can use the `-e` flag.

Test Python 3.8, for example:

```
tox -e py38
```

You need to have the Python versions you are testing against installed on your local system. `tox` searches the system for installed Python versions, but does not install new Python versions. If `tox` doesn't find the Python version its looking for it will give an `InterpreterNotFound` errror.

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a useful tool to install multiple Python versions, if you need to install missing Python versions in your system for local testing.

### Docker

If you install `tox-docker`, tox will take care of setting up all the service containers necessary to run the unit tests and pass the correct environment variables to configure the tests to use these services. Using `tox-docker` is not required, but it is the recommended way to run the tests locally, since it runs the tests in the same way they are run on the Github Actions CI server. 

```
pip install tox-docker
``` 

The docker functionality is included in a `docker` factor that can be added to the environment. To run an environment
with a particular factor you add it to the end of the environment. 

Test with Python 3.8 using docker containers for the services.
```
tox -e py38-docker
```

### Local services

If you already have postgres running locally, you can run it instead by setting the following environment variable:

- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE`

Make sure the ports and usernames are updated to reflect the local configuration.
```
# Set environment variables
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE="postgres://simplified_test:test@localhost:9005/simplified_metadata_test"

# Run tox
tox -e py38
```

### Override `pytest` arguments

If you wish to pass additional arguments to `pytest` you can do so through `tox`. The default argument passed to `pytest` is `tests`, however you can override this. Every argument passed after a `--` to the `tox` command line will the passed to `pytest`, overriding the default.

Only run the `test_cdn` tests with Python 3.6 using docker.

```
tox -e py36-docker -- tests/test_cdn.py
```
